* OUTSTANDING
  * Add :host support to restrict which URL's a rewrite rule matches [10/15/09]
  * Add support for specifying a config file instead of passing a block (e.g. config/rewrite.rb) [10/15/09]
  * Better message than "Redirecting..." -- how about html that says where it's being redirected to? [10/16/09]
  * Provide testing helpers (e.g. should_rewrite) to facilitate straightforward testing. [10/25/09]
  * Allow rules to return arbitrary html (e.g. the contents of the maintenance page) [10/25/09]

* COMPLETED
  * Add :if => lambda support for arbitrary conditional rule application (this will allow us to do the capistrano maintenance page w/o apache's mod_rewrite) [10/15/09]
